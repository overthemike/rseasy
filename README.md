# RSEasy - Structure-Aware RSC Transfer Protocol

A revolutionary approach to React Server Component data transfer that separates object structure from content, enabling intelligent optimization strategies based on structural patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- **Structure-Aware Transfer**: Only send data structure once, then values-only for repeated patterns
- **Automatic Pattern Learning**: Learns access patterns to optimize what data gets sent
- **Request Isolation**: Each RSC request gets isolated state tracking via Valtio
- **Waku Integration**: Seamless integration with Waku's RSC system
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gracefully degrades for non-compatible clients

## 🏗️ Architecture

RSEasy combines three powerful technologies:

1. **[structure-id](../structure-id/)**: Generates unique IDs for object structures using multi-level hashing
2. **[valtio-plugin](../valtio-plugin/)**: Provides isolated proxy instances for state tracking
3. **Custom Protocol**: Intelligently encodes/decodes based on structural patterns
